Prototype by Jana Vareckova and Kevin Singer for the course “Game Design”.

Play it at: <http://m0ru.github.io/powersocketsSvg/>

To run once: `npm start` or `yarn start`.

For development: `npm/yarn start` in one terminal, `npm/yarn run watch` in another.

To generate new maps: Copy the current map, duplicate elements in it using Ctrl+D (to make sure the copies are on the same layer). If you want to change the rotation-pivot, double click the element to go into rotation-mode, then drag the small crosshair. Doing that will change the `inkscape-transform-center-x/y` properties, that are read by the engine.
